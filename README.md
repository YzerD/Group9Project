Summary: We have a homepage that at the top has a Header that has the logo and
name of the project, "Seenima". Then at the other end of the Header we have a
Login and Sign Up button that routes to those respective pages. Below that we
have the SearchBar component and the FilterButton component in the same line.
On click, the FilterButton opens the Filter component that displays 4 
parameters Genres, Decades, Ratings, and Runtime. Then on click of the Apply
Filters button it routes to the FilterResult and displays the appropriate
results. Random Movie does the same with the difference being that instead
of displaying all the results, it posts them to the Database and then randomly
selects one of the response's movie id's to display. Also on the page is three
different movie list categories, that being Latest Release, Upcoming, and Top
Rated.
Completed Work: Header, SearchBar, SearchResult, Trending, Upcoming, TopRated,
SignUp, Login, FilterButton, Filters, RandomButton are all completed
Uncompleted Work: FilterResult and RandomResult aren't completed. The 
challenges that came with completing that work is mostly time and the state
of affairs that happened with the team. I know the general idea of what to
do to complete these, but time and troubleshooting is just not a luxury
I have at this point.
